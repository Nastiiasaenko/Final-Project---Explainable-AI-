# **Comprehensive Dataset for AI Generated Content and Tracing Research**

## **Overview**
This project aims to create a unified, enriched dataset for:
1. **Training Models**: Enable classification of sentiments, political polarization, misinformation, and other markers.
2. **Prompting Texts**: Provide titles and topics to generate AI content.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate AI-generated content against real-world content, tracing its reliance on different sources (e.g., Reddit, news media, social media) and markers (e.g., gender perspectives, political leanings).

The dataset includes:
- **Core Content**: Titles, body text, and source markers (e.g., Reddit, news, Twitter).
- **Enrichment Layers**: Sentiments, political bias, misinformation classification, and more.

## **Datasets**
Below are datasets grouped by category, each linked and described for their potential contributions.

## **Why This Dataset Matters**
For each key topic (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, COVID-19, US Elections), the dataset represents diverse sources:
1. **True News**: Verified sources to compare factual accuracy.
2. **Misinformation**: Explicitly labeled fake news for tracing false narratives.
3. **Polarized Content**: Ideological or emotionally driven discussions.
4. **Social Media**: Organic user discussions capturing public narratives.
