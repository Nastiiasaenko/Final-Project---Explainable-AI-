I don\\u2019t know if this\\u2019ll help any, but I have clinical OCD, germ phobic OCD to boot, and I\\u2019ve experienced traumatic health-related things. (Essentially, a major cancer scare at a young age that made me look my mortality in the face.) Here\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve learned.\\n\\nFirst off: you won\\u2019t be the same right away. For a while, it\\u2019ll feel like there\\u2019s a gaping chasm between the \\u201cbefore\\u201d and the \\u201cafter.\\u201d Your perception of time will be messed up. You might cry or fall into depressive periods at the drop of a hat. That\\u2019s to be expected. \\n\\nBut with time, being around the traumatic thing and being exposed to it directly will get easier. It\\u2019ll start feeling less like this is the \\u201cafter,\\u201d and more like you dealt with a shitty thing but survived. Maybe you\\u2019ll cope with dark humor, or maybe you\\u2019ll never talk about it at all, or maybe you\\u2019ll become an advocate for some issue that means a lot to you. You\\u2019ll find ways. And as you get better at it, you\\u2019ll feel more and more like your old self again. I promise - you\\u2019re a lot more resilient than you could ever anticipate.\\n\\nI started off the pandemic with some major \\u201cd00mer\\u201d expectations. What stood out to me is that people are, inherently, pretty good in the face of crisis. When something horrible and world-shaking happens, the best and worst of humanity comes out. Sure, you have science-denying people who fall for conspiracies and say we should let millions die. But you also have people who put themselves in mortal danger to help their neighbors. You have mega-companies who turn their buildings into giant tributes, people running food banks, volunteers in clinical trials. \\n\\nOur grandparents and great-grandparents lived through disease, wars, famines, and genocides. They came out the other side as the people we loved and respected. This is our moment, and I think we\\u2019ll get through it too - however that might happen.\",\n          \"All of it.

Debbie's brought it to every campaign and every single day of her work in Congress. We've been through quite a few campaigns now, enough to know how it goes. Early voting already started. The election is in eight days. This is what you'd call \\\"crunch time\\\" -- and every deadline is doubly important. I know Debbie's team is trying to raise $218,000 before the end of the month to bring this campaign down the home stretch. Would you be able to pitch in $5 or more to help? when she was a little girl, Debbie never shied away from getting involved if she thought it was worth it. She's always stood up to bullies. The bullies she takes on have changed -- but her attitude hasn't. She'll gladly stand between President Trump and Republicans in Congress when the rights of Florida middle-class families are at stake. We can't let her stand alone. This is the final month of the campaign, if you can believe it. I don't know where this year went, but it's almost gone now. So if you were procrastinating on chipping in, now's the time to stop it.

Lawyers for the Trump administration and Leandra English, a CFPB official, are due to appear at a hearing to consider whether Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump\\u2019s pick to temporarily lead the agency, should be removed. \",\n          \"Home | World | Trump Reveals American Muslim Solution Trump Reveals American Muslim Solution By Michael Ainsworth 10/11/2016 21:21:28 \\nMany U.S. Muslims prefer Sharia law \\nWASHINGTON D.C. \\u2013 USA \\u2013 President elect, Donald Trump has today made his plans for Muslims in America known to reporters. \\n\\nDonald Trump visited the White House today to meet with outgoing president Barack Hussein Obama on plans for the transference of power. To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. \\nTrump\\u2019s landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected. \\nAfter the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. \\nNo Sharia \\n\\u201cI have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can\\u2019t have this savagery amongst us. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We\\u2019ll give them a choice. Let\\u2019s not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.\\u201d \\nAnother reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.\\u201d \\nAs reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. \\nThere are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump\\u2019s election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition.
